<p class="aboutus">About Us</p>


<p>This is a grammar site for elementary students of English. It deals only with grammar and is not a general course site. It combines some exercises.</p>

<p> It can be used for self-study or as supplementary course material.English grammar is the way in which meanings are encoded into wordings in the English language. This includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and whole texts.Grammar is the system of a language. People sometimes describe grammar as the "rules" of a language; but in fact no language has rules. If we use the word "rules", we suggest that somebody created the rules first and then spoke the language, like a new game. But languages did not start like that. Languages started by people making sounds which evolved into words, phrases and sentences. No commonly-spoken language is fixed. All languages change over time. What we call "grammar" is simply a reflection of a language at a particular time.</p></br>
